## Challenges of a confluence or wiki based solution

- Are these docs up to date?
  - IDK but its still broken?? So I'll escalate and wake everyone up
- I left a comment on the confluence page, but the author never made an update to fix the missing link.
- Is there any accountability with this system?
- Who is responsible for holding the developer accountable to update this doc?
- How much time does it take to verify the developer did what "they should" to this doc?
- I dont understand the language in this doc... who do I escalate to?
- Who is held accountable when the docs are changed and no one approved the change, and it was not helpful?
- Structure around the transition to operations
