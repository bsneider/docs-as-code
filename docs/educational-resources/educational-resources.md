## Architecture

### AWS Solutions Architect

Instructor: Adrian Cantrill

"Pass the Certification and become a Solutions Architect

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect is one of the most valuable and in-demand cloud certifications available. It covers all of the core AWS services and is a fantastic entry point into the most popular public cloud platform in the world today.

Getting certified can help improve your confidence and get you interviews, but it's the skills gained along the way which matter long term. With this course, you'll learn everything you need to pass the SAA-C02 exam confidently, but also gain the real-world skills you need to perform well in an interview and function as a mid-level AWS Solutions Architect.

DESIGNED FROM SCRATCH FOR SAA-C02

I've designed the course for the new version of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) certification released on March 23rd, 2020. Rather than updating existing content, I've created a course which directly aligns with the new structure, products, services and architectures contained in the SAA-C02 exam. In addition to SAA-C02, the course provides everything you need for the older SAA-C01 exam too. My commitment to you is this course is up to date when you enroll, and I'll keep it that way for a single lifetime enrollment fee. This course is kept constantly up to date (weekly), see below for the most recent update status.

ðŸš¨ The course is currently on update #45 (Late April 2021) and is 100% valid for the current version of the exam. ðŸš¨"

### Ansible

#### Ansible 101 Course by Jeff Geerling aka GeerlingGuy

Instructor: Jeff Geerling

Completing this course will solve the following questions:

- What is Ansible?
- How to structure my ansible repo? (Spoiler Roles and Playbooks, Collections if advanced)?
- How do I secure the server in the first 5 minutes?
- How do I test my ansible playbooks? TDD w/ Molecule
- Is ansible the golden hammer (aka the right tool for everything)?

Jeff is a fantastic educator, here is a link to his website [https://www.jeffgeerling.com](https://www.jeffgeerling.com).
His course on ansible for DevOps is completely 100% free on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN). The series is 15 videos long, each video in the format of a recorded livestream. Each video is further broken down into small chunks based on the topic, while not recommended for earlier videos, which provide key base knowledge, for later videos jumping around to the content you need is ideal, the small labeled video segments help. Jeff calmly brings his audience from Ansible 0 to Ansible Hero, highlighting best practices, and how to resolve pitfalls. Server and credential security are pervasive throughout, with Jeff often buying hosted servers on the cheapest, and therefore least secure from the start servers. It has an accompanying [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops), and paid book [Ansible for DevOps book $9.99](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com).
Supporting content creators that add value is recommended.

### Terraform

[https://more-than-certified.teachable.com/p/devops-double-bundle/?product_id=3061465&coupon_code=DEVOPS-DUO](https://more-than-certified.teachable.com/p/devops-double-bundle/?product_id=3061465&coupon_code=DEVOPS-DUO)

Instructor: Derek Morgan

"This course will teach you what you need to know to deploy Terraform resources properly and efficiently whether you're a beginner or someone looking for some new tricks! We will start with the very basics and methodically build from there, learning new information, tricks, and skills along the way! Most lessons are less than 8 minutes long to help ensure a pace that doesn't put you to sleep!

With a focus on using built-in tools to deploy and troubleshoot your deployments, you'll be the only one not having to Google every error you find or copy and paste from Stack Overflow!

You'll learn important Terraform tools to troubleshoot and build your infrastructure as you roll out a Node-RED IoT application using Docker, a Rancher K3s Kubernetes deployment on AWS, a Kubernetes deployment of pods, and even a full CICD deployment using Terraform Cloud!

We'll focus on writing efficient code with minimal repetition while utilizing many of Terraform's advanced features such as:

Import
Join
Min
Max
Local Resource
Variables
Splat
For Loops
Dynamic Blocks
Variable Validation
Path References
String Interpolation
Workspaces
Local and Remote Provisioners
and more!
The entire course was recorded using quality equipment for ease of listening, intelligent zooming and cursor highlighting to ensure maximum readability and the ability to follow along easily, and annotations where necessary to quickly see web links to visit, important topics, and follow along with the resources more easily.

All of the code is tested using the 0.14+ version of Terraform and new updates will always be tested and rolled out as soon as possible!"

## Ops (DevOps, SysOps, GitOps, SecOps, DevSecOps)

### How Batman Saved Ops

[How Batman & Robin saved Ops](https://youtu.be/lPjzKrIcRiw?t=92)

Instructor: Boyd Hemphill
Duration: 1hr 25 mins

How to structure Ops to be successful.

"How Batman & Robin saved Ops at Contrast Security - The "second way" according to The Phoenix Project is about rapid response to customers. Too often this means engineers with high privilege end up solving trivial problems instead of providing high value work. At Contrast Security, we decided we needed a super hero to save us and sent up the Bat Signal. Today, Batman - along with his trusty sidekick Robin - keep our Cloud Engineering Team focused while ensuring other teams are unblocked and providing value.

We will talk about Batman and the need for the person in the role to be idle more often than not. The rise of Robin to shorten feedback loop and begin the formation of an improvement kata. Finally, time permitting, we'll share our first stab at the "third way" of Fault Injection a.k.a. Chaos Engineering."

Lessons are never more than 20 minutes and often much shorter - I prioritize efficiency, not duration. Each section includes a quiz helping you retain knowledge, and at the end of the course, weâ€™ve designed a full practice exam which mirrors real-world conditions.
